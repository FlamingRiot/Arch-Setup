# Requirements 
In order for the configuration to install correctly, you should have installed Arch Linux with the base requirements. 
No graphical environement needed, everything comes with the config and the intallation script. To run the install script on your 
blank Arch machine, execute the following command : 
````
./install.sh
````
You may need to enter confirmations for tools during the installation, simply press 'O' or 'y', whichever is asked. 
The system should then reboot itself automatically.
